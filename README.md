# ProgrammingChallenges

Repository displaying approaches to solving common fun programming challenges found in HackerRank/LeetCode. Some generated code is included, but the solutions are marked with a comment //SOLUTION.

The solution code displays programming style and where readability is chosen over one liners. Some challenges like 'Check Permutations' or 'Find Elements in Sorted Rotated Array' contain custom implementations of common algorithms, in order to boost execution time.

Overall the repository serves as a fun playground to see different approaches to common algorithm problems. Enjoy.
